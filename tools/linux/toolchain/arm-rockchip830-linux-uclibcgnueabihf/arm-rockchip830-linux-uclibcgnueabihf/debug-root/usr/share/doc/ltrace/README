This directory contains sources of ltrace.  See the file configure.ac
to see what version this is.

Ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until the
command exits.  While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and
records both the dynamic library calls called by the executed process
and the signals received by the executed process.  Ltrace can also
intercept and print system calls executed by the process.

For general building and installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.

For list of authors and contributors, see the file CREDITS.

ltrace is free software.  See the file COPYING for license.

Some documentation on ltrace usage is given in the manual page, which
is in the file ltrace.1.

Bug Reports
-----------

You can send bug reports to <ltrace-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>.
User requests can also be directed to that address.

If the ltrace package that you are using came with your operating
system, please be sure to reproduce the problem in unmodified upstream
version of ltrace before reporting a bug.


Development
-----------

ltrace development is hosted by Alioth.Debian.org:

  https://alioth.debian.org/projects/ltrace/

Release tarballs can be downloaded here:

  https://alioth.debian.org/frs/?group_id=30892

Anonymous GIT access is available via:

  git://git.debian.org/git/collab-maint/ltrace.git

If you have anything to contribute, please send an e-mail to
<ltrace-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>, and attach your patches
formatted with git format-patch.  This makes them easy to apply after
